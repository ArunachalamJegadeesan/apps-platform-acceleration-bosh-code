# Code for the Bosh Course Labs

This is the code needed to complete the 
[Platform Acceleration BOSH Course](https://github.com/pivotal-education/platform-acceleration-bosh).

It is broken up in two versions to correspond the the progression of the code as you move through the lab.

```bash
v1 - Starting point for the first lab
v2 - Articulate deployment with cloud configuration extracted
```

This branch includes the solution to the final lab. Look at the changes to [articulate.yml](./articulate.yml) and
[cloud_config.yml](./cloud-config.yml). To see the changes more clearly, take a look at the 
[diff](compare/v2...final_lab_solution).
